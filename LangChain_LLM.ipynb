       "Document(page_content='In this passage from the book \"Crime and Punishment,\" the protagonist, Raskolnikov, listens to a man named Marmeladov recount his troubled home life. Marmeladov explains how his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, has been struggling financially and has resorted to dressing up and entertaining guests to maintain appearances. He also reveals that his daughter, Sonia, has been helping them financially but can only visit them secretly. Marmeladov then confesses that he stole money from Katerina\\'s box and spent it on alcohol, leaving his family in a dire situation. Despite his remorse, Marmeladov tries to lighten the mood by mentioning that he went to see Sonia that morning and asked her for a drink. The passage ends with Marmeladov expressing his desire for forgiveness and redemption.\\n\\nOverall, this passage provides insight into the difficult circumstances faced by Marmeladov and his family. It highlights Katerina\\'s efforts to maintain appearances despite their poverty and Marmeladov\\'s guilt over his actions. The passage also touches on the theme of redemption, as Marmeladov expresses his hope for forgiveness and a better future. Through Marmeladov\\'s story, the reader gains a deeper understanding of the struggles faced by the characters in the novel and the moral dilemmas they grapple with.\\nIn this passage, Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Raskolnikov, informing him of her plans to marry Pyotr Petrovitch. She explains that she believes she can gain influence over Pyotr and hopes that he will help pay for Raskolnikov\\'s university studies. However, she has not mentioned these plans to Pyotr yet, as she wants Raskolnikov to meet him on equal footing. Pulcheria also expresses her desire to live independently after the wedding and hopes to settle near Raskolnikov. She ends the letter by informing him that she and his sister, Dounia, will be traveling to Petersburg soon and that they may all be together again after three years of separation.\\n\\nUpon reading the letter, Raskolnikov\\'s face is wet with tears, but as he finishes, a bitter and wrathful smile appears on his lips. He is filled with anger and resentment towards his mother and sister for making this decision without consulting him. He is determined to prevent the marriage from happening and believes that they will not be able to deceive him. Raskolnikov questions their motives and wonders if they were open with each other about their intentions. He is particularly upset by his mother\\'s statement that Dounia loves him more than herself, as it suggests that she may have sacrificed her daughter for her son.\\n\\nAs Raskolnikov ponders over the letter, he becomes increasingly bitter and even contemplates murdering Pyotr if he were to encounter him. He is filled with resentment towards his family for making decisions without his input and feels betrayed by their actions. The passage ends with Raskolnikov feeling cramped and stifled in his small room and deciding to go out, muttering to himself as he walks.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov comes across a young woman who appears to be drunk and distressed. He is concerned for her well-being and tries to intervene when he notices a dandy following her. Raskolnikov wants to protect her from any harm and keep her out of the dandy\\'s hands. However, the constable and the dandy do not take his concerns seriously, and the woman eventually walks away. Raskolnikov reflects on his actions and feels guilty for not being able to help her.\\n\\nAfter this encounter, Raskolnikov remembers that he had intended to go to his friend Razumihin\\'s house to ask for work or assistance. However, he questions the usefulness of seeking help from Razumihin and wonders if it will truly solve his problems. He contemplates the possibility of a significant event, referred to as \"It,\" happening and changing everything. This thought excites him, and he decides to delay his visit to Razumihin until after \"It\" occurs.\\n\\nThroughout the passage, Raskolnikov\\'s inner turmoil and conflicting emotions are evident. He is torn between wanting to help the young woman and feeling powerless to do so. He also struggles with his own sense of purpose and whether seeking help from others will truly make a difference in his life. The passage highlights Raskolnikov\\'s isolation and his desire for a fresh start, as well as his complex relationship with his friend Razumihin.\\nIn this passage, the protagonist is reminiscing about his love for a church and the old priest who used to serve there. He also mentions the graves of his grandmother and younger brother, whom he never knew but still pays respects to. The protagonist then has a dream where he is walking with his father towards a graveyard and notices a festive scene outside a tavern. He sees a cart being pulled by a weak horse, which reminds him of the mistreatment he has witnessed towards similar horses in the past. A group of drunken peasants invite people to join them in the cart, and the protagonist is horrified by the abuse they inflict on the horse. He tries to intervene but is stopped by his father. The dream ends with the protagonist waking up in a state of terror and confusion.\\n\\nThe passage explores themes of compassion, cruelty, and the protagonist\\'s internal struggle. The protagonist\\'s love for the church and his religious rituals at the gravesite highlight his reverence for tradition and his connection to his family. However, his dream reveals a darker side of humanity, as he witnesses the abuse of a horse by drunken peasants. The protagonist\\'s horror and attempts to intervene demonstrate his empathy and desire to protect the vulnerable. The dream leaves him feeling broken and confused, questioning the nature of his own existence and the world around him.\\n\\nOverall, this passage delves into the protagonist\\'s emotions and moral dilemmas, showcasing his internal conflict between his compassionate nature and the harsh realities of the world.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov overhears a conversation between a huckster and his wife, and Lizaveta Ivanovna, the younger sister of the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna. Lizaveta is described as a tall, clumsy, and submissive woman who is constantly mistreated by her sister. The huckster and his wife invite Lizaveta to their home the next day, and Raskolnikov is overcome with a strange sensation upon hearing this. He realizes that Lizaveta will be away from home, leaving Alyona Ivanovna alone at seven o\\'clock. This information seems to have a significant impact on Raskolnikov, as he feels that everything is suddenly and irrevocably decided.\\n\\nLater on, Raskolnikov learns why the huckster and his wife invited Lizaveta. They were looking for a dealer to buy their household goods and clothes, and Lizaveta often undertakes such jobs. Raskolnikov becomes superstitious and sees this as a strange and mysterious coincidence. He recalls a previous encounter where a student mentioned Alyona Ivanovna\\'s name, and now he hears more details about her from the same student. The student describes Alyona as a spiteful and uncertain pawnbroker, and mentions Lizaveta, her submissive and timid sister. Lizaveta is described as being constantly with child and working day and night for her sister.\\n\\nThe passage ends with the student proposing a hypothetical situation where killing Alyona Ivanovna and taking her money could be used for the greater good of helping those in need. This idea seems to disturb Raskolnikov, as he shudders at the thought. The passage highlights Raskolnikov\\'s growing obsession with the idea of committing a crime and the internal struggle he faces as he contemplates the consequences and moral implications of his actions.\\nIn this passage, the protagonist is described as eating mechanically and without appetite. He lies on the sofa, unable to sleep, and is plagued by daydreams of being in Africa. Suddenly, he is startled by the sound of a clock striking and realizes how late it is. He becomes wide awake and rushes to the door, listening on the staircase. He is filled with a sense of urgency and begins to prepare for something, making a noose and sewing it into his overcoat. He also retrieves a pledge, a piece of wood with an iron strip, from under the sofa. He then hears someone in the yard and rushes out, descending the stairs cautiously. He still needs to steal an axe from the kitchen, which he had decided long ago would be the weapon he would use. He considers the potential complications of retrieving the axe and decides to put off thinking about them for now. He reflects on why crimes are often poorly concealed and easily detected, and concludes that it is due to a failure of will and reasoning power in the criminal. He believes that he will not experience this failure and that his reason and willpower will remain intact when he carries out his plan. However, he acknowledges that his final decisions are the ones he trusts the least and that things may not go as planned.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, the protagonist, Raskolnikov, is on his way to the house of an old woman whom he plans to rob and murder. As he approaches the house, he notices a clock striking half-past seven, which surprises him. He manages to enter the house unnoticed, taking advantage of a wagon of hay that blocks him from view. He ascends the stairs cautiously, listening for any signs of people, but finds the area deserted. He reaches the fourth floor and locates the old woman\\'s flat, as well as the empty flat opposite. He listens at the door and hears a sound on the other side, indicating that someone is inside. He rings the bell, but there is no answer. He becomes anxious and rings again, but still no response. Finally, he hears the latch being unfastened and the door opens slightly. Raskolnikov tries to prevent the old woman from closing the door, and when she steps back in alarm, he enters the room uninvited. The old woman is suspicious and questions him, but he manages to distract her by showing her the pledge he promised to bring. She takes the pledge, and Raskolnikov notices that she is scrutinizing him. He becomes nervous and tells her he is in a hurry. As he starts to lose his composure, he suddenly blurts out that he is pale because he hasn\\'t eaten. The old woman accepts his explanation and takes the pledge. Raskolnikov then takes out an axe he had hidden and strikes the old woman on the head, killing her. He delivers several more blows to ensure her death. Afterward, he retrieves the keys from her pocket and goes into the bedroom, where he finds a chest of drawers. As he begins to unlock the chest, he experiences a moment of hesitation but quickly dismisses it. However, he suddenly fears that the old woman might still be alive and could regain consciousness. He briefly considers attacking her again but ultimately decides against it. He leaves the room and continues with his plan.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, the protagonist, Raskolnikov, is in a state of extreme distress and paranoia. He is convinced that he is being punished for a crime he has committed, and his mental faculties are deteriorating. He becomes fixated on the idea that there may be blood stains on his clothes, and frantically searches for evidence of this. He finds traces of blood on his pocket and sock, confirming his fears. Raskolnikov contemplates burning the evidence, but ultimately decides to throw it away. However, he is too weak to leave his room and is interrupted by a knock on the door. It is a notice from the police summoning him to the police station. Raskolnikov is bewildered by this, as he has no involvement with the police. He becomes increasingly anxious and paranoid as he prepares to leave his room, but ultimately decides to face the situation head-on.\\n\\nIn this passage, the reader gets a glimpse into Raskolnikov\\'s deteriorating mental state. He is consumed by guilt and paranoia, convinced that he is being punished for a crime he has committed. His obsession with finding evidence of blood stains on his clothes reflects his fear of being discovered. Raskolnikov\\'s thoughts are scattered and he struggles to make rational decisions. He contemplates burning the evidence, but ultimately decides to throw it away. However, he is too weak to leave his room and is interrupted by a notice from the police summoning him to the police station. This further adds to his anxiety and confusion.\\n\\nThe passage also highlights the oppressive and suffocating atmosphere of Raskolnikov\\'s surroundings. The heat, stench, and crowdedness of the streets and police station contribute to his sense of unease. The description of the staircase as steep, narrow, and sloppy with dirty water adds to the sense of discomfort and claustrophobia. The newly decorated rooms in the police station are described as having a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil. These details serve to heighten the tension and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the scene.\\nIn this passage, Raskolnikov is summoned to a government office for the recovery of money. He is given a document stating that he owes a hundred and fifteen roubles to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn. Raskolnikov insists that he is not in debt to anyone and is confused by the situation. Meanwhile, the assistant superintendent becomes furious with Raskolnikov for arriving late and begins shouting at him. Raskolnikov, in turn, becomes angry and stands up for himself, claiming that he will not allow anyone to shout at him. The head clerk looks at Raskolnikov with a smile, while the assistant superintendent continues to berate him.\\n\\nAs the argument escalates, the assistant superintendent turns his attention to a smartly dressed lady who had been smiling at him. He accuses her of causing a scandal and threatens to put her in the lock-up if there is another incident. The lady defends herself, claiming that there was no fighting or noise in her house and that Raskolnikov came drunk and caused the disturbance. The assistant superintendent dismisses her and warns her to be careful. The superintendent of the district, Nikodim Fomitch, enters the office and comments on the commotion. He tries to calm the situation and defends Raskolnikov, stating that poverty is not a vice. However, the assistant superintendent continues to belittle Raskolnikov and mocks him for protesting against his smoking.\\n\\nOverall, this passage depicts a tense encounter between Raskolnikov and the government officials. Raskolnikov is initially relieved to discover that the notice is not about money, but confusion arises when he realizes that he is being accused of owing a debt. The assistant superintendent becomes increasingly angry and confrontational, while Raskolnikov stands up for himself and refuses to be shouted at. The situation escalates when the assistant superintendent berates a lady for causing a scandal, and the superintendent tries to defuse the tension.\\nIn this passage, Raskolnikov is confronted by his friend Razumihin, who is angry and confused about why Raskolnikov came to see him. Raskolnikov leaves and walks on the Nikolaevsky Bridge, where he is almost hit by a carriage and then mocked by onlookers. However, an elderly woman and her daughter give him money out of pity. Raskolnikov then stands on the bridge, looking at the cathedral and feeling a sense of familiarity and unease. He suddenly throws the money into the water and returns home, feeling disconnected from everything.\\n\\nWhen Raskolnikov arrives home, he falls into a deep sleep and is woken up by the sound of his landlady being brutally beaten by Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent. Raskolnikov is shocked and confused by this violence and wonders why Ilya Petrovitch came to their building. Nastasya, who is taking care of him, denies that anyone was beating the landlady and suggests that Raskolnikov\\'s feverish state is causing him to imagine things. Raskolnikov asks for something to drink and then falls back into unconsciousness.\\n\\nDuring his illness, Raskolnikov experiences delirium and hallucinations. He remembers people arguing and discussing him, and feeling alone in the room with occasional glimpses of others. He recognizes Nastasya, but cannot remember the identity of another person who visits him. The passage ends with Raskolnikov feeling confused about the passage of time and the events that have occurred during his illness.\\nIn this passage, Mr. Luzhin visits Raskolnikov, who is ill, and expresses regret at finding him in this situation. He mentions that he has found a lodging for Raskolnikov\\'s mother and sister in Bakaleyev\\'s house, which Razumihin describes as a disgusting and questionable place. Mr. Luzhin defends the lodging, stating that it is clean and temporary, as he has already taken a permanent flat for himself. He also mentions his acquaintance with Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry, whom Raskolnikov vaguely recognizes. Mr. Luzhin praises the younger generation for their clearer views and practicality, which Zossimov agrees with. However, Razumihin disagrees, stating that practicality is difficult to find and that ideas are still fermenting. Mr. Luzhin argues that acquiring wealth for oneself ultimately benefits society as a whole. The conversation becomes heated, and Razumihin abruptly ends it. Mr. Luzhin takes his leave, and the discussion shifts to the murder of an old pawnbroker. Razumihin believes that the murderer was inexperienced and impulsive, while Mr. Luzhin expresses interest in the details of the case.\\n\\nIn this passage, Mr. Luzhin visits Raskolnikov, who is ill, and expresses regret at finding him in this situation.

Razumihin is noticeably drunk and Raskolnikov informs him that he has won a bet. Raskolnikov is weak and cannot stay long, so he asks Razumihin to see him home.

He appears to be in a state of intense emotion and agitation.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov introduces his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and his sister, Dounia, to Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of a man who was recently killed. Raskolnikov asks about the arrangements for the funeral and expresses concern about the police. Sofya explains that the lodgers are angry about the body remaining in the apartment, but Katerina Ivanovna, the deceased\\'s wife, insists on having a funeral lunch. Raskolnikov observes Sofya closely and notes her thin, pale face and childlike gestures.\\n\\nAfter the conversation, Raskolnikov\\'s mother and sister leave, and Sofya is left alone with him. Raskolnikov thanks her for her help and squeezes her hand warmly. He then reflects on his father\\'s death and the impact it has had on him. \\n\\nIn the next section, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia discuss their visit with Raskolnikov. Pulcheria expresses relief at leaving and worries about Raskolnikov\\'s health. Dounia reassures her mother and criticizes Pyotr Petrovitch, who has been writing about Sofya. Pulcheria is concerned about Sofya\\'s influence on Raskolnikov and shares her worries with Dounia.\\n\\nFinally, Raskolnikov speaks with his friend Razumihin about his belongings that are pawned. He is concerned about losing his sister\\'s ring and his father\\'s watch. Razumihin suggests going to Porfiry, who is managing a murder case and has been inquiring about pawned items. Raskolnikov agrees and they decide to go together.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov is being questioned by Porfiry Petrovitch about the items he pawned. Raskolnikov is anxious about the situation because the items hold sentimental value to him. He becomes defensive when Razumihin suggests that he was worried about Porfiry\\'s inquiries. Raskolnikov tries to downplay his concern but reveals that his mother is with him and would be devastated if she knew the watch was lost. Porfiry seems uninterested in Raskolnikov\\'s emotional attachment to the items and calmly offers an ashtray to Razumihin. \\n\\nRaskolnikov becomes increasingly angry and wonders why they are tormenting him. He questions their motives and wonders if they are intentionally trying to upset him. He also questions why they are speaking in a certain tone and why Porfiry mentioned that he was at the lodging of a man who had been run over. Raskolnikov becomes paranoid and suspicious of their intentions. Porfiry returns and tries to lighten the mood, asking about the party from the previous day. The conversation then shifts to a discussion about crime and the socialist doctrine. Raskolnikov becomes defensive and argues against the idea that crime is solely a protest against social organization. \\n\\nOverall, this passage highlights Raskolnikov\\'s increasing paranoia and suspicion as he is questioned by Porfiry. It also reveals his emotional attachment to the pawned items and his concern for his mother\\'s reaction. The passage also touches on the theme of crime and the socialist doctrine, with Raskolnikov disagreeing with the idea that crime is solely a protest against society.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov engages in a conversation with Porfiry Petrovitch about the nature of extraordinary individuals and their actions. Raskolnikov believes that there are two categories of people: those who preserve the world and those who move the world towards its goal. He believes that both categories have an equal right to exist. Porfiry questions Raskolnikov\\'s beliefs, asking if he believes in the New Jerusalem and in God. Raskolnikov affirms his belief in both. \\n\\nPorfiry then asks Raskolnikov about his belief in the literal rising of Lazarus from the dead, to which Raskolnikov also affirms. They discuss how extraordinary individuals sometimes triumph in their lifetime and may even execute others if necessary. Porfiry asks how one can distinguish these extraordinary people from ordinary ones, suggesting that they should wear a special uniform or be branded. Raskolnikov dismisses this idea, stating that confusion may arise but it is mostly among ordinary people who imagine themselves to be advanced and destroyers. \\n\\nPorfiry expresses his concern about the possibility of many people having the right to kill others, particularly those who imagine themselves to be future Lycurgus or Mahomet. Raskolnikov acknowledges that such cases may arise, especially among the vain and foolish. He believes that society is well protected by prisons and other measures, and that catching the thief is the solution. Porfiry questions what happens if the thief is caught, and Raskolnikov states that he will get what he deserves and suffer for his mistake. The conversation ends with Porfiry suggesting that Raskolnikov may have fancied himself as an extraordinary man while writing his article, to which Raskolnikov responds with contempt.\\nIn this passage, Svidrigaïlov and Raskolnikov continue their conversation. Svidrigaïlov reveals that Marfa Petrovna, his wife, had been pleased with his warmth towards Raskolnikov\\'s sister. He also mentions that women sometimes enjoy being insulted, and that he and Marfa Petrovna had a harmonious relationship. Svidrigaïlov then talks about his past as a card-sharper and his boredom with society. He mentions that he has been seeing ghosts of Marfa Petrovna, and Raskolnikov admits that he had suspected something of the sort. \\n\\nSvidrigaïlov explains that Marfa Petrovna had a document that could trap him if he were to become restless in their relationship. However, she eventually gave him the document back and a large sum of money. He also mentions that he managed their estate well and ordered books. Svidrigaïlov then asks Raskolnikov if he believes in ghosts, and reveals that Marfa Petrovna has visited him three times since her death. Raskolnikov is surprised by this revelation and admits that he had suspected something was happening to Svidrigaïlov. \\n\\nOverall, this passage provides insight into Svidrigaïlov\\'s relationship with Marfa Petrovna, his past as a card-sharper, and his current state of boredom. It also introduces the supernatural element of Marfa Petrovna\\'s ghost visiting Svidrigaïlov.\\nIn this passage, Pyotr Petrovitch arrives at the home of Pulcheria Alexandrovna and her daughter, Dounia. He is initially put out and embarrassed, but maintains his politeness. They all sit down at a table and there is a moment of silence. Pyotr Petrovitch blows his nose and contemplates leaving, but decides to stay and seek an explanation for their disobedience. He asks about their journey and if Dounia is tired. Pulcheria Alexandrovna expresses her gratitude for the help they received from Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin. Pyotr Petrovitch becomes hostile towards Razumihin and the conversation becomes tense. Pulcheria Alexandrovna brings up the death of Marfa Petrovna and Pyotr Petrovitch informs them that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov has left for Petersburg. Pulcheria Alexandrovna is worried about Dounia\\'s safety and Pyotr Petrovitch assures her that he will find out where Svidrigaïlov is staying. He then goes on to describe Svidrigaïlov as a depraved and vicious man. Dounia questions the evidence of his claims and Pyotr Petrovitch reveals that Marfa Petrovna had told him about Svidrigaïlov\\'s involvement in the death of a young girl. Dounia defends Svidrigaïlov, stating that she heard a different story about the suicide of a servant. Pyotr Petrovitch continues to express his concerns about Svidrigaïlov\\'s intentions and Dounia asks him to stop talking about him. Raskolnikov then reveals that Svidrigaïlov had visited him and wants to have a meeting with Dounia. He also mentions that Marfa Petrovna left Dounia a sum of money in her will. Pulcheria Alexandrovna is relieved and Pyotr Petrovitch decides to leave.\\nIn this passage from Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov is in a state of extreme agitation and asks Sonia to read to him. Sonia hesitates, but eventually begins reading from the Bible. As she reads the story of Lazarus, Raskolnikov becomes increasingly emotional, realizing that Sonia is sharing her own personal beliefs and struggles with him. He sees her desire to read to him as a way of confessing her faith and finding solace in it. Despite the difficulty of reading aloud, Sonia continues, and Raskolnikov is moved by the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead.\\n\\nAfter Sonia finishes reading, Raskolnikov abruptly changes the subject and tells her that he has abandoned his family. He expresses a desire for them to go together, as they are both outcasts and understand each other\\'s pain. Sonia is confused and alarmed by his words, not fully comprehending his intentions. Raskolnikov explains that they must face reality and take control of their lives, rather than passively accepting their suffering. He believes that they can find freedom and power by breaking societal norms and embracing their own desires.\\n\\nSonia is overwhelmed by Raskolnikov\\'s words and begins to cry, unsure of what to do. Raskolnikov tells her to break what needs to be broken and take on the suffering herself. He emphasizes the importance of power and the ability to control one\\'s own destiny. Raskolnikov hints that this may be the last time he speaks to Sonia and urges her to remember his words. He believes that one day she will understand the significance of what he is saying.\\nIn this passage, Raskolnikov is preparing to meet with Porfiry Petrovitch, whom he despises and fears. He vows to remain calm and silent during their meeting, but as soon as he enters Porfiry\\'s study, he becomes aware of his own trembling. However, his indignation at his fear causes him to stop trembling and adopt a cold and arrogant demeanor. Porfiry greets Raskolnikov warmly and offers him a seat, but Raskolnikov remains suspicious of his intentions.\\n\\nPorfiry shows Raskolnikov a paper about a watch, but quickly dismisses it as unnecessary. Raskolnikov then brings up the topic of being questioned formally about his acquaintance with the murdered woman. He begins to feel uneasy and fearful in Porfiry\\'s presence, sensing that there may be something unknown to him. Porfiry tries to ease the tension by making small talk and offering Raskolnikov a cigarette, but Raskolnikov\\'s repulsion towards Porfiry grows.\\n\\nRaskolnikov abruptly decides to leave, expressing his irritation and lack of time. Porfiry is taken aback and tries to calm him down, assuring him that there is no hurry and that he is glad Raskolnikov has come to see him. He attributes his own laughter to his nerves and tries to make Raskolnikov sit back down. Raskolnikov remains silent and watches Porfiry closely, still feeling angry and suspicious. Porfiry continues to talk, discussing the difficulty of finding conversation topics with people of similar intelligence. Raskolnikov reluctantly puts down his cap and continues to listen.\\nIn this passage, Porfiry Petrovitch, a detective, is speaking to Raskolnikov, the main character. Porfiry discusses the power of wit and how it can deceive even the most intelligent individuals. He mentions that a criminal\\'s temperament can betray them, causing them to faint or act in ways that give away their guilt.

Raskolnikov continues to feel uneasy and seeks solace in solitude, but is unable to escape his troubled thoughts.\\nIn this passage, Raskolnikov is confronted by Svidrigaïlov, who questions him about his recent actions.

He brings them fifteen thousand roubles as a present and asks them to keep it safe. The parents are grateful and impressed by Svidrigaïlov\\'s generosity. After the visit, Svidrigaïlov crosses a bridge and walks along a street, eventually finding a hotel called Adrianople. He rents a room and overhears an argument in the adjacent room between two men.

       "'The story revolves around a young man named Raskolnikov who is living in a state of extreme anxiety and isolation due to his impoverished condition. He is deeply in debt and fears encountering his landlady, whom he owes money. The oppressive heat and unpleasant surroundings of the city further contribute to his distress. Raskolnikov is planning a project, the nature of which is not revealed, and is filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness about it. He visits an old woman\\'s house, where he tries to pawn a silver watch, but the amount she offers him leaves him feeling disgusted and confused. \\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s financial struggles are highlighted as he tries to pawn his belongings for money. His inner turmoil and self-disgust are evident as he aimlessly wanders the city, trying to make sense of his thoughts and emotions. He ends up in a tavern, where he meets a man named Marmeladov. Marmeladov is a retired clerk who engages Raskolnikov in conversation, revealing his own struggles with poverty and alcoholism. \\n\\nMarmeladov shares his story of despair and desperation, revealing the hardships his family faces due to his alcoholism. His wife, Katerina Ivanovna, works tirelessly to support their three children, despite being sick and living in harsh conditions. Marmeladov confesses to selling his wife\\'s belongings for alcohol and expresses concern for her health and their children\\'s future. \\n\\nRaskolnikov also learns about Marmeladov\\'s daughter, Sonia, who has resorted to doing odd jobs to help support the family. Despite their hardships, Marmeladov admires his wife\\'s spirit and determination. Raskolnikov is deeply affected by Marmeladov\\'s story and his own encounter with the old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, to whom he owes money. He is filled with self-disgust and confusion, and he seeks solace in the tavern. \\n\\nRaskolnikov then has a vision of the day of judgment, where he believes that God will forgive those who have shown love and compassion. He is convinced that God will forgive Sonia, a woman he cares deeply for. However, his words are met with laughter and mockery from those around him. \\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s life takes a chaotic turn when he returns home to find his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, accusing him of being a criminal and demanding to know where their money is. He manages to hide some money before leaving the house. The next day, he wakes up feeling ill-tempered and annoyed with his living situation. He receives a letter from his mother, who reveals that his sister, Dounia, has agreed to marry a man named Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. Raskolnikov is bitter and angry about the decision, feeling that his opinion was not taken into consideration. He believes that the marriage is a business arrangement and questions the motives of both Dounia and her mother. \\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s inner turmoil and conflicting emotions are evident as he tries to navigate his own conscience and the world around him. He is torn between wanting to help others and feeling powerless to do so. He also struggles with his own sense of guilt and the desire for a fresh start. The story provides insight into Raskolnikov\\'s character and his internal struggles as he navigates the complexities of his own conscience and the world around him.The protagonist of the story, Raskolnikov, is in a state of mental turmoil and distress. He is grappling with guilt and confusion over a \"base, filthy degrading business\" he has undertaken, which is later revealed to be a murder. His internal struggle is so intense that it manifests physically, causing him to wander aimlessly and react violently to his surroundings. He visits his friend, Razumihin, who is taken aback by Raskolnikov\\'s disheveled state and tries to offer help, but Raskolnikov rejects his assistance and leaves abruptly.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s mental state continues to deteriorate as he roams the streets, encountering various people who either provoke his anger or pity him. He is given money by an elderly woman and her daughter, but he throws it into the Neva river, symbolizing his disconnection from society. He returns home and falls into a deep sleep, during which he experiences delirium and hallucinations. He is visited by a man named Vahrushin who brings him money from his mother, but Raskolnikov is hesitant to accept it. Despite his reluctance, he eventually signs a paper acknowledging the transaction.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s friend, Razumihin, takes care of him during his illness, feeding him and engaging him in conversation. Razumihin reveals that he has been investigating Raskolnikov\\'s affairs and has become acquainted with various people in his life, including his landlady, Pashenka. Raskolnikov admits to lying about his mother\\'s financial situation and feels guilty about it. He also becomes paranoid about being discovered and considers escaping to America.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s paranoia and confusion intensify when he is visited by Mr. Luzhin, who has found a lodging for Raskolnikov\\'s mother and sister. The conversation between them becomes heated, and they discuss the murder of an old pawnbroker. Raskolnikov believes that the murderer was inexperienced and impulsive, while Mr. Luzhin expresses interest in the details of the case.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s mental state continues to deteriorate as he roams the streets, encountering various people and engaging in conversations that reveal his knowledge of the murder. He teases Zametov, the head clerk, about his infatuation with a woman and challenges his ability to catch criminals. Raskolnikov also describes in detail how he would commit a crime, hinting at his involvement in the murder.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s interactions with others, particularly Razumihin and Zametov, highlight his arrogance and belief in his own intelligence. He criticizes their abilities and challenges their views, causing tension and confusion. Despite his deteriorating mental state, Raskolnikov remains intrigued by the murder case and continues to hint at his involvement.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s mental state reaches a critical point when he witnesses a woman attempting to drown herself. He feels disgusted by the situation and contemplates ending his own life. He visits the house where the murders took place and is thrown out onto the street when he reveals his identity. The story ends with Raskolnikov in a state of emptiness and apathy, symbolizing his complete disconnection from society and his own humanity.In the novel Crime and Punishment, the protagonist, Raskolnikov, encounters a man named Marmeladov who has been injured in a carriage accident. Raskolnikov intervenes, persuading the police to bring Marmeladov to his home rather than a hospital. At Marmeladov\\'s home, his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, is distressed about their financial situation. The arrival of her injured husband adds to her worries, but Raskolnikov assures her that he will cover the medical expenses. As the room fills with onlookers, Katerina Ivanovna becomes angry at their lack of sensitivity. The landlady, Madame Lippevechsel, tries to restore order, leading to a disagreement with Katerina Ivanovna over the name she should be addressed by.\\n\\nThe narrative then shifts to a chaotic scene where Semyon Zaharovitch, Marmeladov\\'s real name, is dying. Katerina Ivanovna is distraught and demands respect for her dying husband from the gawking onlookers. The room is filled with lodgers from the flat, leading to a heated argument between Katerina Ivanovna and the landlady, Amalia Ludwigovna. The argument is interrupted by the arrival of a doctor, who declares that Semyon will not survive. A priest arrives to administer the last rites, and Katerina Ivanovna prays with her children. A young girl named Sonia enters the room, looking frightened and out of place.\\n\\nThe narrative then shifts to Raskolnikov\\'s departure from the scene of a murder. He encounters Nikodim Fomitch, who notices blood stains on Raskolnikov\\'s waistcoat. Raskolnikov explains that he has been at a deathbed and gave away all his money. He then visits his friend Razumihin\\'s apartment, where he informs him that he has won a bet. Raskolnikov is weak and cannot stay long, so he asks Razumihin to see him home. Razumihin reveals that one of the visitors, Zossimov, thinks Raskolnikov is either mad or close to it.\\n\\nRazumihin passionately defends the value of talking nonsense and making mistakes as a means of reaching the truth. He expresses his frustration with society\\'s reliance on other people\\'s ideas and the lack of progress in various fields. Despite his outburst, he apologizes and assures Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Avdotya Romanovna that he respects them. Razumihin then leaves to gather news and bring Zossimov, a doctor, back to the room.\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna and Avdotya Romanovna discuss their concerns about Raskolnikov\\'s behavior and his illness. Pulcheria is worried about leaving him alone, while Avdotya believes that his illness is the reason for his sullenness. They anxiously await Razumihin\\'s return and discuss their hopes that Raskolnikov will change his mind about his actions.\\n\\nRazumihin confronts his friend, Zossimov, about his lazy and indulgent lifestyle. Zossimov, a doctor, is criticized for sleeping on a feather bed and not being dedicated to his patients. Razumihin convinces Zossimov to spend the night in the landlady\\'s flat, where he can get to know her better. Zossimov is hesitant, but Razumihin assures him that there is no romantic involvement and that he won\\'t regret it.\\n\\nRaskolnikov prepares for the day by washing himself meticulously. He decides not to shave his stubbly chin, fearing that others will think he did so intentionally for a specific reason. Raskolnikov reflects on his own behavior and wonders why he is proud of certain qualities when they are not something to be proud of. He contemplates being intentionally dirty and rude to counteract this pride.\\n\\nRaskolnikov\\'s mother and sister visit him after his recent strange behavior. Raskolnikov apologizes to his sister for their previous dispute and holds out his hand to her in reconciliation. His mother is overjoyed at this gesture and is impressed by Raskolnikov\\'s actions. However, she also notices that he is dressed poorly and finds his appearance strange.\\n\\nRaskolnikov then explains that he had been delirious and had given away all the money his mother had sent him to a widow in need. He admits that he had no right to do so, but felt compelled to help. The conversation then turns to the recent death of Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov, whom Raskolnikov had been acquainted with. Pulcheria Alexandrovna reveals that Svidrigaïlov had beaten his wife, which ultimately led to her death. Dounia defends Svidrigaïlov, stating that he had been patient and considerate during their marriage, but Pulcheria Alexandrovna insists that he was an awful man.\\n\\nIn the end, Raskolnikov speaks with his friend Razumihin about his belongings that are pawned. He is concerned about losing them and asks for advice on whether to go to the police or to Porfiry Petrovitch, who is managing a murder case. Razumihin suggests going to Porfiry, and they decide to go together.In the novel Crime and Punishment, a series of events unfold that delve into the lives and minds of the characters. An unknown gentleman, who appears younger than his age, follows Sonia to her lodging and discovers that they are neighbors. He mentions that he had a waistcoat altered by Kapernaumov, Sonia\\'s landlord, and finds the coincidence amusing. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Raskolnikov and Razumihin are on their way to Porfiry\\'s place. Razumihin is excited about the visit, which Raskolnikov finds curious. Razumihin brings up the fact that Raskolnikov had pledged items at the old woman\\'s place, which makes Raskolnikov wonder how this information has spread among people. Upon arriving at Porfiry\\'s flat, Raskolnikov tries to control his laughter, while Razumihin causes a commotion by breaking a table and glass. Porfiry finds the situation amusing and asks for an explanation.\\n\\nRaskolnikov is later questioned by Porfiry about the items he pawned, which makes him anxious as they hold sentimental value to him. He becomes defensive when Razumihin suggests that he was worried about Porfiry\\'s inquiries because he had something to hide. Raskolnikov tries to downplay his concern, but also mentions that his mother would be devastated if she knew the watch was lost. Porfiry reveals that he had been expecting Raskolnikov and calmly offers an ashtray to Razumihin, who is scattering cigarette ash on the carpet. \\n\\nRaskolnikov becomes increasingly agitated and wonders why they are tracking him and why they are speaking to him in a certain tone. He suspects that they know about the flat and feels that they are trying to catch him. Porfiry returns and becomes more jovial, asking about Raskolnikov\\'s party the previous day. They discuss the topic of crime and Raskolnikov becomes defensive, arguing that crime is a protest against the abnormality of society. \\n\\nRaskolnikov learns that an article he wrote six months ago was published in the Periodical Review, despite him sending it to the Weekly Review. He is surprised by this news and realizes that he could have received money for the article. They discuss the content of the article, which analyzes the psychology of a criminal before and after committing a crime. Raskolnikov admits that he suggested in the article that extraordinary individuals have the right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, as long as it is essential for the practical fulfillment of their ideas. \\n\\nRaskolnikov engages in a conversation with Porfiry about the nature of extraordinary individuals and their actions. He believes that there are two categories of people: those who preserve the world and those who move the world towards its goal. He believes that both categories have an equal right to exist. Porfiry questions Raskolnikov\\'s beliefs, asking if he believes in the New Jerusalem and in God. Raskolnikov affirms his belief in both. \\n\\nRaskolnikov is discussing his encounter with Porfiry and Zametov with his friend Razumihin. Raskolnikov is suspicious of their behavior and believes that they are trying to throw him off by being impudent and careless. He also believes that they have no real evidence against him and are just trying to intimidate him. Raskolnikov is frustrated by their insinuations and insults, but Razumihin encourages him to not be downhearted and to stand up to them.\\n\\nRaskolnikov is lost in thought and feeling humiliated. He leaves the room and encounters a porter who points him out to a short man who looks like an artisan. The man asks about Raskolnikov and then walks away without saying anything. Raskolnikov follows him and eventually catches up to him. He asks why the man was asking for him, but the man simply calls him a murderer and walks away. \\n\\nRaskolnikov wakes up from a dream in which he imagines himself attacking an old woman with an axe. He is disturbed by the laughter and whispering he hears from the bedroom and is unable to move or scream. When he finally wakes up, he finds a stranger in his room named Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov explains that he has come to make Raskolnikov\\'s acquaintance and seek his assistance in winning over Raskolnikov\\'s sister, Avdotya Romanovna. \\n\\nSvidrigaïlov and Raskolnikov have a conversation about various topics. Svidrigaïlov expresses his sadness and dissatisfaction with life, stating that he would rather be at home where he can blame others for his problems. He mentions that he has been told about a balloon expedition and asks Raskolnikov if he would go up in the balloon. Raskolnikov wonders if Svidrigaïlov is serious and questions his intentions.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch arrives at the home of Pulcheria Alexandrovna and her daughter, Dounia. He is initially put out and tries to maintain his dignity, but is clearly bothered by something. They all sit down at a table and there is a moment of silence. Pyotr Petrovitch blows his nose and contemplates leaving, but decides to stay and seek an explanation for something that has happened. \\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch confronts Pulcheria Alexandrovna and her family about a misunderstanding that occurred between him and Raskolnikov. Pyotr accuses Raskolnikov of misrepresenting his words and insulting him, and he demands an explanation from Pulcheria about how she repeated his words in a letter to Raskolnikov. \\n\\nIn the novel, the characters are discussing the idea of starting a publishing firm to make a living. Dounia is excited about the idea, while Pulcheria Alexandrovna is unsure but willing to give it a try. Raskolnikov thinks it\\'s a good idea and suggests they start by publishing five or six books. Razumihin suggests they all live together in a flat and offers to pawn his watch to help with the expenses. However, Raskolnikov suddenly decides to leave and tells his family to forget about him and not inquire about him. His mother and sister are alarmed, but he insists on being alone and leaves.\\n\\nAfter leaving his family, Raskolnikov goes to visit Sonia, a woman he is acquainted with. He finds her in a small, low-pitched room that she rents from the Kapernaumovs. The room is sparsely furnished and shows signs of poverty. Raskolnikov examines the room while Sonia watches him nervously. He comments on her thinness and takes her hand, noting how transparent it looks. Raskolnikov asks about her living arrangements and learns that the Kapernaumovs live in a separate room through a locked door. He then abruptly changes the subject and tells Sonia that he may not see her again.\\n\\nRaskolnikov confronts Sonia about her sinful lifestyle and questions how she can live in such degradation while still having holy feelings. He suggests that it would be better for her to end her life, but Sonia is not surprised by his suggestion and even considers it herself.

They then sit down to talk, and Dounia feels uneasy in his presence.In the book, the character Svidrigaïlov is introduced as a man who holds a unique perspective on humanity, dividing people into two categories: material and superior beings. He believes that superior beings are above the law and are responsible for creating laws for the rest of mankind. He also asserts that many men of genius have broken the law without hesitation, and he considers himself a genius, albeit one who has failed to break the law.

Svidrigaïlov then cleans the blood from his temple, takes the revolver, and leaves the room.\\n\\nLater that evening, Svidrigaïlov visits various low places and treats the people he encounters. He is drawn to two clerks with crooked noses and takes them to a pleasure garden. There, a fight breaks out between the clerks and some others, and Svidrigaïlov is chosen to settle the dispute. However, the argument is too loud to understand, and the only thing that is clear is that one of the clerks stole a teaspoon from the garden. Svidrigaïlov pays for the spoon and leaves. He returns home, takes out his money, tears up some papers, and prepares to change his clothes. However, he decides against it and goes to visit Sonia, who is with the Kapernaumov children.

Svidrigaïlov then leaves, and Sonia is left in a state of anxiety.\\n\\nLater that evening, Svidrigaïlov visits his betrothed\\'s parents\\' house. He gives his betrothed money as a present and informs her that he must leave Petersburg for a while.

The mother concludes that Svidrigaïlov is a man of great wealth and connections and that his actions are not surprising.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov is haunted by the image of a young girl who had drowned herself. He remembers her as a broken-hearted fourteen-year-old, whose purity had been tarnished by an insult. Svidrigaïlov is disturbed by this memory and opens the window to let in the wind and rain. He contemplates the flooding river and decides to go out to the park. On his way, he encounters a neglected and wet five-year-old girl hiding in a corner. He takes her back to his room, undresses her, and puts her to bed. However, he is disturbed by a nightmare in which the girl\\'s face transforms into that of a depraved woman.

She mentions that his sister, Dounia, has been distant lately and has been keeping secrets. Despite this, Pulcheria assures Raskolnikov that Dounia loves him and respects him.

They embrace and Pulcheria cries, feeling a sense of foreboding about her son\\'s future.\\n\\nRaskolnikov then tells his mother that he must leave and asks her to always love him. She promises to do so and asks if he is going far away. He confirms that he is and asks her to pray for him. They say their goodbyes and Raskolnikov leaves. He goes to his lodgings and finds his sister, Dounia, waiting for him. She expresses relief that he is still alive and asks where he was all night. Raskolnikov admits that he considered ending his life but couldn\\'t bring himself to do it. He tells Dounia that he doesn\\'t understand his own actions and feels like a contemptible person.\\n\\nDounia reassures him that he is ready to face suffering and he admits that he was afraid of the water when he considered drowning himself. Raskolnikov then decides to give himself up to the authorities but doesn\\'t know why he is doing it. Dounia cries and embraces him, and he questions whether she doubted his willingness to face the consequences of his actions. She holds him close and kisses him, and he becomes angry, denying that he committed a crime and justifying the murder of the pawnbroker as atonement for her sins. He questions why everyone is calling it a crime and expresses frustration at their judgment.\\n\\nRaskolnikov is preparing to leave his apartment and go to the police station. He is feeling agitated and fearful, and he is unsure if he made the right decision to confess his crime. He is also concerned about Sonia, who he had shouted at earlier, and wonders if he should have said goodbye to her. As he walks through the city, he is overwhelmed by his emotions and begins to question his actions and motives.\\n\\nRaskolnikov walks through the crowded Hay Market, feeling distasteful being in a crowd but unable to be alone. He sees a drunk man dancing and falling down, and briefly laughs before forgetting about him. He then has a moment of realization, recalling Sonia\\'s words about going to the crossroads and confessing to being a murderer. This realization overwhelms him, and he falls to the ground, kissing the earth with bliss and rapture.\\n\\nAfter this emotional moment, Raskolnikov continues on his way to the police station. He enters the building and encounters Ilya Petrovitch, the explosive lieutenant. Raskolnikov is surprised to see him and wonders why he is there. Ilya Petrovitch is in a good mood and offers to help Raskolnikov. They have a brief conversation, and Raskolnikov confirms his identity as Rodion Romanovitch.\\n\\nRaskolnikov learns that a man named Svidrigaïlov has shot himself. He is shocked by this news and reveals that he knew Svidrigaïlov, as his sister was a governess in his family. Raskolnikov is asked if he had any suspicion about Svidrigaïlov\\'s actions, but he claims to have known nothing. Overwhelmed by the news, Raskolnikov decides to leave and goes down the stairs, feeling dizzy and disoriented. He encounters Sonia, who looks horrified, and he stands before her with an ugly smile before returning to the police office.\\n\\nBack at the police office, Raskolnikov approaches Ilya Petrovitch, who is rummaging through papers. Raskolnikov appears ill and struggles to speak, but eventually confesses that he is the one who killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them. Ilya Petrovitch is surprised by this revelation, and Raskolnikov repeats his statement. People gather around, and the passage ends with Raskolnikov\\'s confession hanging in the air.'"
